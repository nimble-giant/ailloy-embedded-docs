# Blanks

Blanks are the source files of the Ailloy compiler. They are Markdown instruction templates that live in mold directories, define commands and skills for your AI coding tool, and are compiled with flux variables via `ailloy forge` (dry-run) or `ailloy cast` (install).

## Mold Structure

A mold's directory layout is flexible. You can organize your blanks into whatever directories make sense for your team — the `output:` mapping in `flux.yaml` is what determines where each directory's files end up in the target project. There is no required set of directory names.

The only constraints are:

- **Reserved root files** are mold metadata and are never installed: `mold.yaml`, `flux.yaml`, `flux.schema.yaml`, `ingot.yaml`, `README.md`, `PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md`, `LICENSE`, and `.ailloyignore`
- **`ingots/`** is reserved for reusable template partials (see [Ingots](ingots.md))
- **Hidden directories** (starting with `.`) are excluded from auto-discovery
- **Ignored files** specified via `.ailloyignore` or `mold.yaml` `ignore:` are excluded (see [Ignoring Files](#ignoring-files))

Everything else — directory names, nesting, file types — is up to you. A mold with `prompts/` and `guidelines/` directories is just as valid as one with `commands/` and `skills/`:

```
my-mold/
├── mold.yaml
├── flux.yaml
├── prompts/
│   ├── deploy-checklist.md
│   └── incident-response.md
└── guidelines/
    └── code-style.md
```

```yaml
# flux.yaml
output:
  prompts: .ai/prompts
  guidelines: .ai/guidelines
```

### Conventions from the Official Mold

The [official mold](https://github.com/nimble-giant/nimble-mold) establishes a set of conventions that many teams follow. These are patterns, not requirements:

#### Commands

Command blanks define commands that users invoke explicitly in their AI coding tool. In the official mold they live in a `commands/` directory and are installed to `.claude/commands/` for Claude Code.

```
my-mold/
└── commands/
    ├── brainstorm.md
    ├── create-issue.md
    └── open-pr.md
```

After `ailloy cast`, each file becomes available as a command in your AI coding tool (e.g., `/brainstorm`, `/create-issue` in Claude Code).

#### Skills

Skill blanks define proactive workflows that your AI coding tool uses automatically based on context, without requiring explicit command invocation. In the official mold they live in a `skills/` directory and are installed to `.claude/skills/`.

```
my-mold/
└── skills/
    └── code-review-style.md
```

Skills are ideal for instructions that should always be available — coding standards, review guidelines, or domain-specific knowledge.

#### Workflows

Workflow blanks are GitHub Actions YAML files. In the official mold they live in a `workflows/` directory and are installed to `.github/workflows/`. Because workflow files contain raw YAML syntax that conflicts with Go template delimiters, they are typically configured with `process: false` in the output mapping:

```yaml
output:
  workflows:
    dest: .github/workflows
    process: false
```

Workflow blanks are only installed when using `ailloy cast --with-workflows`.

### Tool-Agnostic Instructions

Molds can include an `AGENTS.md` file at the root to provide tool-agnostic agent instructions that work with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and other tools. See [AGENTS.md](agents-md.md) for details.

## Creating Your First Blank

### 1. Set up a mold directory

The quickest way to get started is `ailloy mold new <name>`, which scaffolds a valid mold with sample blanks. Or manually:

```bash
mkdir my-mold && cd my-mold
```

### 2. Write `mold.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: mold
name: my-team-mold
version: 1.0.0
description: "My team's AI workflow blanks"
author:
  name: My Team
  url: https://github.com/my-org
```

### 3. Write `flux.yaml` with output mapping

The `output:` key maps source directories in your mold to destination paths in the target project:

```yaml
output:
  commands: .claude/commands
  skills: .claude/skills

project:
  organization: my-org

scm:
  provider: GitHub
  cli: gh
```

### 4. Create a command blank

```bash
mkdir -p commands
```

Write `commands/deploy-checklist.md`:

```markdown
# Deploy Checklist

Generate a deployment checklist for {{ project.organization }}.

## Steps

1. Use `{{ scm.cli }}` to check for open PRs targeting the release branch
2. Verify all CI checks are passing
3. List recent commits since last deploy
4. Generate a summary of changes
```

### 5. Preview with `forge`

```bash
ailloy forge ./my-mold
```

This renders all blanks with your flux values and prints the output — a dry run that lets you verify templates before installing.

### 6. Install with `cast`

```bash
ailloy cast ./my-mold
```

This compiles and installs the rendered blanks into the directories defined by your `output:` mapping (e.g., `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code).

## Template Syntax

Blanks use Go's [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) engine with a preprocessing step that simplifies variable references.

### Simple variables

Use `{{ variable }}` to reference top-level flux values. The preprocessor automatically adds the Go template dot prefix, so you don't need to write `{{ .variable }}`:

```markdown
Organization: {{ project.organization }}
CLI tool: {{ scm.cli }}
```

Both `{{ variable }}` and `{{ .variable }}` work — use whichever you prefer.

### Dotted path access

Nested flux values are accessed with dotted paths:

```markdown
Provider: {{ scm.provider }}
Board: {{ project.board }}
Status field: {{ ore.status.field_id }}
```

### Conditionals

Use Go template conditionals (these require the dot prefix since they use Go template keywords):

```markdown
{{if .ore.status.enabled}}
## Status Tracking

Update the status field ({{ .ore.status.field_id }}) after each step.
{{end}}
```

### Ranges

Iterate over lists:

```markdown
{{range $key, $value := .items}}
- {{ $key }}: {{ $value }}
{{end}}
```

### Including ingots

Use the `{{ingot "name"}}` function to include reusable template partials:

```markdown
# My Command

## Standard Preamble
{{ingot "team-preamble"}}

## Command-Specific Instructions
...
```

The ingot's content is rendered through the same template engine with the same flux context. See the [Ingots guide](ingots.md) for details on creating and managing ingots.

### Preprocessor rules

The preprocessor converts simple `{{variable}}` references to `{{.variable}}` before Go template parsing. It skips Go template keywords (`if`, `else`, `end`, `range`, `with`, `define`, `block`, `template`, `ingot`, `not`, `and`, `or`, `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`, `len`, `index`, `print`, `printf`, `println`, `call`, `nil`, `true`, `false`) so they are not dot-prefixed.

### Unresolved variables

Variables that cannot be resolved from the flux context produce a logged warning and resolve to empty strings. The template does not fail — this allows progressive development where not all variables need to be set immediately.

## Flux Variables in Blanks

Blanks reference values defined in `flux.yaml` (or overridden via `-f` files and `--set` flags). See the [Flux guide](flux.md) for full details on defining and layering values.

### Value precedence

When blanks are rendered, flux values are resolved in this order (lowest to highest priority):

1. `mold.yaml` `flux:` schema defaults
2. `flux.yaml` defaults
3. `-f, --values` flux overrides (left to right)
4. `--set` flags

### Multiline values

Use YAML block syntax for multiline flux values:

```yaml
api:
  post_review: |-
    gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<pr-number>/reviews \
      --method POST \
      --field body="<summary>"
```

Then reference in blanks: `{{ api.post_review }}`

## Blank Discovery

Blanks are automatically discovered from your mold's directory structure. The `output:` mapping in `flux.yaml` determines how directories map to destinations — your directory names are not prescribed:

- **Map output** — each key maps a source directory (whatever you named it) to a destination
- **String output** — all top-level directories go under the specified parent
- **No output key** — files are placed at their source paths (identity mapping)

Non-reserved root-level files (e.g., `AGENTS.md`) are auto-discovered and installed to the project root. The `ingots/` directory, reserved root files, and hidden directories (starting with `.`) are always excluded from auto-discovery.

## Ignoring Files

Molds often contain files that are useful within the mold repository — documentation, examples, contributor guides — but should not be cast into the target project. You can exclude files using `.ailloyignore` or the `ignore` field in `mold.yaml`. Both approaches work with `ailloy cast` and `ailloy forge`. Ignored files are still included when packaging with `ailloy smelt`.

### `.ailloyignore` file

Place a `.ailloyignore` file at the mold root with glob patterns for files and directories to exclude:

```
# Mold documentation - not for target projects
docs/
examples/

# Specific files
CONTRIBUTING.md
*.example
```

This follows the familiar `.gitignore` convention. Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are comments.

### `ignore` field in `mold.yaml`

Add an `ignore` key to your mold manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: mold
name: my-mold
version: 1.0.0
ignore:
  - docs/
  - examples/
  - CONTRIBUTING.md
```

### Pattern syntax

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `docs/` | Everything under the `docs/` directory |
| `docs/**` | Same as `docs/` |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | A specific file by name |
| `*.example` | Any file ending in `.example` at any level |
| `docs/*.md` | Files matching the glob against their full path |

### Combining both sources

When both `.ailloyignore` and `mold.yaml` `ignore:` are present, patterns from both sources are merged. Use `.ailloyignore` for simple, visible exclusions and `mold.yaml` `ignore:` for programmatic or manifest-driven control.

### Effect on operations

| Operation | Ignore applied? |
|-----------|----------------|
| `ailloy cast` | Yes — ignored files are not installed |
| `ailloy forge` | Yes — ignored files are not rendered |
| `ailloy smelt` | No — all files are included in the package |

## Testing and Previewing

### Dry-run render

Preview what `cast` will produce without writing any files:

```bash
ailloy forge ./my-mold
ailloy forge ./my-mold --set project.organization=my-org
ailloy forge ./my-mold -o /tmp/preview  # write to directory
```

### Validation

Check your mold's structure, manifests, and template syntax:

```bash
ailloy temper ./my-mold
```

This catches template syntax errors, missing manifest fields, and broken file references before you distribute your mold. See the [Validation guide](temper.md) for details.

## Getting Started with Examples

The [official mold](https://github.com/nimble-giant/nimble-mold) provides a reference implementation using the commands/skills/workflows convention. It's a good starting point, but remember that your mold's directory structure is yours to define — the `output:` mapping makes any layout work. For a step-by-step guide to creating a full mold from scratch, see the [Packaging Molds guide](smelt.md).

## Targeting Different AI Tools

The `output:` mapping in `flux.yaml` determines where blanks are installed, making the same mold portable across AI coding tools. Change the output paths to target your tool of choice:

### Claude Code

```yaml
output:
  commands: .claude/commands
  skills: .claude/skills
```

### Cursor

```yaml
output:
  rules: .cursor/rules
```

### Windsurf

```yaml
output:
  rules: .windsurf/rules
```

### Generic (agents.md compatible)

The [agents.md](https://agents.md) format is supported by many AI coding tools. Place instructions at the project root:

```yaml
output:
  agents: .
```

### Multi-tool

You can target multiple tools from the same mold by mapping source directories to multiple destinations:

```yaml
output:
  commands: .claude/commands
  skills: .claude/skills
  cursor-rules: .cursor/rules
```

Since `output:` lives in flux, consumers can override destination paths at install time using `-f` value files or `--set` flags. This means a single mold can serve teams using different AI coding tools.

### Fan-out: one source, many destinations

When the same source directory should render to multiple destinations — for example, an agent definition that needs to land in `.claude/agents/`, `.opencode/agents/`, and `.cursor/rules/` — use a list of destinations:

```yaml
output:
  agents:
    - dest: .claude/agents
      set:
        agent.current_target: claude
    - dest: .opencode/agents
      set:
        agent.current_target: opencode
    - dest: .cursor/rules
      set:
        agent.current_target: cursor
```

Each list entry can be either a string (just a destination path) or a map with `dest`, optional `process`, and optional `set`. The `set` map injects values into the template context for that render pass only — without touching the global flux. Inside the template, switch on the injected value:

```markdown
{{- if eq .agent.current_target "claude" -}}
---
name: coding-agent
model: opus
---
{{- else if eq .agent.current_target "opencode" -}}
---
mode: primary
model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-20250514
---
{{- end -}}

{{ingot "coding-agent-body"}}
```

Keys in `set` may use dotted paths (`agent.current_target`) which expand to nested maps, or be nested maps directly. The fan-out form works for both directory mappings and individual file mappings.

### Fan-in: many sources, one destination

The mirror case — multiple molds (or multiple output entries within one mold) all writing to the same destination file — is solved by `strategy: merge`. When two molds each declare MCP server entries in `opencode.json`, by default the second cast overwrites the first; declaring `strategy: merge` deep-merges JSON/YAML destinations instead of clobbering. See [`strategy` in the flux reference](flux.md#strategy--merge-or-replace-output-files) for the value table, merge semantics (map order preservation, array concat-with-dedupe, type-mismatch rules), and the `--force-replace-on-parse-error` escape hatch for hand-edited destinations.
