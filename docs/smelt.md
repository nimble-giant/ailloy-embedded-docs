# Packaging Molds with `ailloy smelt`

The `smelt` command packages a mold directory into a distributable format. It follows the same pattern as Helm's chart packaging: lean metadata in `mold.yaml`, default values in `flux.yaml`, and optional validation in `flux.schema.yaml`.

Two output formats are available:

- **`tar`** (default): A `.tar.gz` archive that can be extracted and used with `ailloy cast ./extracted-mold`
- **`binary`**: A self-contained executable with the mold baked in — run `./my-mold cast` directly

## Directory Structure

A mold directory uses clean top-level directories for source files. The `output:` field in `flux.yaml` defines where each directory maps to in the target project:

```
my-mold/
├── mold.yaml                # Required - metadata
├── flux.yaml                # Optional - default values + output mappings
├── flux.schema.yaml         # Optional - validation rules
├── AGENTS.md                # Optional - tool-agnostic agent instructions
├── commands/
│   └── my-command.md        # Command blanks
├── skills/
│   └── my-skill.md          # Skill blanks
├── workflows/
│   └── ci.yml               # Workflow files
└── ingots/                  # Optional - ingot partials
    └── my-ingot/
        ├── ingot.yaml
        └── partial.md
```

Root-level files like `AGENTS.md` are auto-discovered and installed to the project root during `cast`. Mold metadata files are excluded from auto-discovery — see [Reserved root files](#reserved-root-files) below.

## Step 1: Write `mold.yaml`

This is lean metadata — the mold's identity and version constraints:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: mold
name: my-team-mold
version: 1.0.0
description: "Our team's AI workflow blanks"
author:
  name: My Team
  url: https://github.com/my-org
requires:
  ailloy: ">=0.2.0"
```

## Step 2: Write `flux.yaml` (optional)

Default values for flux variables, like Helm's `values.yaml`. The `output:` key maps source directories in your mold to destination paths in the target project. Use nested YAML to group related values:

```yaml
output:
  commands: .claude/commands
  skills: .claude/skills
  workflows:
    dest: .github/workflows
    process: false

project:
  organization: my-org
  board: Engineering

scm:
  provider: GitHub
  cli: gh
  base_url: https://github.com
```

### Output mapping forms

**Simple map** — directory-to-directory mappings:

```yaml
output:
  commands: .claude/commands
  skills: .claude/skills
```

**Expanded map** — per-directory options like disabling template processing:

```yaml
output:
  workflows:
    dest: .github/workflows
    process: false          # skip Go template processing
```

**No output key** — files are placed at their source paths (identity mapping):

```yaml
# omitting output: means commands/my-cmd.md → commands/my-cmd.md
```

### Root-level files

Root-level files in the mold (e.g. `AGENTS.md`) are auto-discovered alongside directories. In the string and identity output forms, they are installed to the project root — the parent prefix only applies to directories. In the map form, root files can be mapped explicitly:

```yaml
output:
  commands: .claude/commands
  AGENTS.md: AGENTS.md        # explicit root file mapping
```

### Reserved root files

The following root-level files are treated as mold metadata and are **not** auto-discovered. They describe the mold itself, not content to install. Files starting with `.` are also excluded.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mold.yaml` | Mold manifest |
| `flux.yaml` | Flux variable defaults |
| `flux.schema.yaml` | Flux validation schema |
| `ingot.yaml` | Ingot manifest |
| `README.md` | Mold documentation (not project readme) |
| `PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md` | Plugin summary metadata |
| `LICENSE` | Mold license file |

Any other root-level file (e.g. `AGENTS.md`) will be auto-discovered and installed. Mold authors can also use the map output form to explicitly control root file mapping regardless of this list.

Since output lives in flux, consumers can override destination paths using the standard flux layering (`-f` value files or `--set` flags).

Blanks reference nested values with dotted paths: `{{ scm.provider }}`, `{{ project.board }}`, etc.

Multiline values use YAML block syntax:

```yaml
api:
  post_review: |-
    gh api repos/:owner/:repo/pulls/<pr-number>/reviews \
      --method POST \
      --field body="<summary>"
```

If you omit `flux.yaml`, smelt will generate one from any `flux:` declarations in `mold.yaml`.

## Step 3: Write `flux.schema.yaml` (optional)

Only declare variables that need validation. You don't need to list every variable from `flux.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: project.organization
  type: string
  required: true
  description: "GitHub org name"
- name: project.board
  type: string
```

Supported types: `string`, `bool`, `int`, `list`, `select`.

When present, `flux.schema.yaml` is used for validation during `forge` and `cast`, and drives the interactive wizard during `ailloy anneal`. If absent, ailloy falls back to any `flux:` declarations in `mold.yaml`. If neither exists, no validation is performed.

### Select type

Use `type: select` with static options for variables that have a fixed set of choices:

```yaml
- name: scm.provider
  type: select
  description: "Source control provider"
  options:
    - label: GitHub
      value: github
    - label: GitLab
      value: gitlab
    - label: Bitbucket
      value: bitbucket
```

### Schema discovery (optional)

Flux variables can declare a `discover` block to dynamically populate options from external commands during `ailloy anneal`:

```yaml
- name: project.id
  type: string
  description: "Default project board"
  discover:
    command: "gh api graphql -f query='...' -f org='{{.project.organization}}'"
    parse: |
      {{- range .data.organization.projectsV2.nodes -}}
      {{ .title }}|{{ .id }}|{{ .title }}|{{ .number }}
      {{ end -}}
    also_sets:
      project.board: 0
      project.number: 1
    prompt: select
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `command` | Yes | Shell command to execute. Supports `{{.variable}}` template expansion against current flux values. |
| `parse` | No | Go template applied to JSON output. Each line should be `label\|value` or just `value`. Extra pipe-delimited segments beyond `label\|value` are available to `also_sets`. If omitted, each line of stdout becomes an option. |
| `prompt` | No | `"select"` for a dropdown, `"input"` for freeform text (default). |
| `also_sets` | No | Maps additional flux variable names to extra segment indices (0-based into segments after `label\|value`). Allows a single selection to populate multiple variables. |

Discovery commands run lazily during `ailloy anneal` when the user reaches the relevant wizard section. If a discovery command's template dependencies (e.g. `{{.project.organization}}`) are not yet populated, the wizard shows a waiting placeholder until the user fills them in. If a command fails, the wizard falls back to manual input with a warning.

## Step 4: Create your blanks

> **Tip:** Use `ailloy mold new <name>` to scaffold a valid mold directory with boilerplate files. This creates `mold.yaml`, `flux.yaml`, `AGENTS.md`, and sample blanks — a ready-to-edit starting point.

Add command blanks to `commands/`, skill blanks to `skills/`, and workflow files to `workflows/`. The `output:` mapping in `flux.yaml` determines where they end up in the target project. Reference flux variables with Go template syntax:

```markdown
# My Command

Use `{{ scm.cli }}` to interact with {{ scm.provider }}.

Organization: {{ project.organization }}
```

## Step 5: Validate (optional)

Before packaging, validate your mold's structure, manifests, and template syntax:

```bash
ailloy temper ./my-mold
```

This catches errors early — missing manifest fields, broken file references, and template syntax issues. See the [Validation guide](temper.md) for details.

## Step 6: Package it

```bash
ailloy smelt ./my-mold
```

Output:

```
Smelting mold...
Smelted: my-team-mold-1.0.0.tar.gz (4.2 KB)
```

To write the tarball to a specific directory:

```bash
ailloy smelt ./my-mold --output ./dist
```

If you omit the path, smelt defaults to the current directory:

```bash
cd my-mold/
ailloy smelt
```

The alias `ailloy package` also works.

## What goes in the tarball

The archive includes all files discovered from the mold directory:

- `mold.yaml`
- `flux.yaml` (source file if present, otherwise generated from `flux:` declarations)
- `flux.schema.yaml` (if present)
- All files in directories referenced by `output:` in `flux.yaml` (or all top-level directories if `output:` is omitted)
- Everything in the `ingots/` directory (if present)

The tarball is named `{name}-{version}.tar.gz` and entries are prefixed with `{name}-{version}/`.

## Binary Output

The binary format creates a self-contained executable by embedding the mold files into a copy of the ailloy binary using [stuffbin](https://github.com/knadh/stuffbin).

### Creating a binary

```bash
ailloy smelt -o binary ./my-mold
```

Output:

```
Smelting mold...
Smelted: my-team-mold-1.0.0 (12.3 MB)
```

To write to a specific directory:

```bash
ailloy smelt -o binary ./my-mold --output ./dist
```

### Using a binary

The output binary is a portable ailloy with a baked-in mold. When `cast` or `forge` is run without a mold-dir argument, the embedded mold is used automatically:

```bash
# Cast the ailloy into a project
./my-team-mold-1.0.0 cast

# Preview the rendered output
./my-team-mold-1.0.0 forge

# Override flux values
./my-team-mold-1.0.0 cast --set project.organization=my-org

# Layer additional flux files
./my-team-mold-1.0.0 cast -f production.yaml
```

You can still pass an explicit mold-dir to override the embedded mold:

```bash
./my-team-mold-1.0.0 cast ./other-mold
```

### What goes in the binary

The binary includes the same files as the tarball (see above). The output is named `{name}-{version}` (no extension) and is made executable.

## CLI Reference

```
ailloy smelt [mold-dir] [flags]
```

| Argument | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `mold-dir` | `.` (current directory) | Path to the mold directory |

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--output` | | `.` (current directory) | Output directory for the archive |
| `--output-format` | `-o` | `tar` | Output format (`tar` or `binary`) |

## Using a Mold

After packaging (or directly from source), use `forge` to preview and `cast` to install:

```bash
# Preview rendered output (dry run, like helm template)
ailloy forge ./my-mold

# Write rendered output to a specific directory
ailloy forge ./my-mold -o /tmp/preview

# Install blanks into the current project
ailloy cast ./my-mold

# Override flux values at install time
ailloy forge ./my-mold --set project.organization=my-org --set scm.provider=GitLab
```

## Value Precedence

When a mold is installed with `forge` or `cast`, flux values are resolved in this order (lowest to highest priority):

1. `mold.yaml` `flux:` schema defaults
2. `flux.yaml` defaults
3. `-f, --values` flux overrides
4. `--set` flags
